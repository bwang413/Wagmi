# References

This repository contains extensive references (ie. chains & connectors) for the wagmi repositories.

The purpose of the references monorepo is so that contributors can open discussions (and PRs) for additional chains & connectors without it polluting the `wagmi` repository itself.

It consists of:

- **[Chains](/packages/chains/)**: An extensive collection of chains (e.g. mainnet, polygon, bsc, etc) to use in wagmi.
- **Connectors** (Soon): A collection of connectors (e.g. Injected, WalletConnect, etc) to use in wagmi
